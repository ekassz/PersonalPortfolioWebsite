## Personal Portfolio Project
My site is now live to checkout at: https://emiliportfolio.netlify.app/

I mainly worked with JS, React, and Bootstrap to complete this project. I wanted to showcase my resume and experience in a way that I could also show my creativity through design and the interface side of programming. Hopefully with a glimpse of this site, you'll be more aware as to who I am as an engineer, student, and woman in tech!
